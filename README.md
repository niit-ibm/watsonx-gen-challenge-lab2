This IBM watsonx.ai hands-on lab introduces you to some of the core components and capabilities of IBM watsonx.ai. Specifically, you will get hands-on experience in the following areas: 

Strengths and weaknesses of different models 

Meaning of different configuration parameters and how they influence a model in generating output 

Zero-shot and one-shot prompting (and by extension few-shot prompting) 

Generating list and JSON files with foundation models 

Code generation and translation 

Saving prompts as well as prompt sessions (to keep the history of all your changes) 

Restoring the prompt to an earlier state via prompt history 

Saving prompts to a Jupyter notebook and working with the Jupyter notebook 

To understand more about the interface of watsonx.ai, we highly encourage you to read the document ‘How to get to watsonx’ where the web-based user interface (UI) is described more thoroughly. It includes the Prompt Lab, the Structured and Freeform interface, model parameter configuration panels, and model information panels. 

Summary 

At the end of this lab, you will be able to open a new Prompt Lab session and navigate the watsonx.ai interface, including selecting and experimenting with different foundation models. You will understand the importance of prompt engineering and how to modify prompts familiar with zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques and how to use them effectively. Additionally, you will learn to adjust inference parameters such as temperature, top P, and top K to influence model outputs. You will also be able to generate structured outputs like lists and JSON, and use stop sequences to control model generation. Finally, you will know how to save prompts and prompt sessions, and understand the importance of testing model outputs, especially for code-based tasks.
